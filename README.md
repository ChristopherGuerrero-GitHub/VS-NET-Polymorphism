# VS-NET-Polymorphism

//This program has a sub class Dog that inherits from the parent/super class Animal. Both have same name access method
// move() and makeNoise() using the polymorphism process by using the "virtural" keyword in the parent/super class
// and the "override" keyword in the child/subclass for the same name access method.
